# SQL Fundamentals for Analyst and Data Analyst

Welcome to the SQL Fundamentals for Analyst and Data Analyst Workshop, a complete hands-on interactive experience to learn the basics of SQL Server Management Studio.

This site is curated for my SQL Fundamentals for Analyst and Data Analyst sharing session. It contains several references that I find useful across over the internet, and would love to share it with other learners. While it is not an exhaustive list, this is a repository with high-yield links sites that will help beginners in learning SQL. 

**Prerequisites** - Before you attend the workshop, download the files and the scripts for hands-on exercises with one of the following methods:
- Clone the workshop repo with **git clone** https://github.com/Syarmine/SQL-Masterclass.git. Using this method, the scripts will be under folders by module 
inside sqlworkshops-sql2022workshop\sql2022workshop. You can download git for windows from https://gitforwindows.org or using Github for Dekstop.
- or download the files and scripts one by one from this page. You will need to expand the zip file after downloading.
- A virtual machine or computer running Windows 10, Windows 11, with at least 4 CPUs and 8Gb RAM. You will need Administrator rights on the virtual machine or computer. It is recommended to use your own personal laptop, **do not** use company laptop or owned by others.
